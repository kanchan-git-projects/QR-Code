## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library


### What I learned

During this project, I learned how to structure a React component for displaying a QR code and how to make it responsive using CSS. I also improved my skills in using flexbox for layout purposes.

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to focus on further improving my CSS skills, particularly in the areas of animations and transitions. I also plan to explore more advanced React concepts and libraries to enhance my frontend development capabilities.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This comprehensive resource helped me understand various HTML, CSS, and JavaScript concepts in detail.
- [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) - The official React documentation provided valuable guidance on working with React components and state management.
